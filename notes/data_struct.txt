Array:
    - Retreival : CONSTANT TIME O(1)
    - Resizing (appending, prepending, inserting) - O(n)


Linked List:
    - Retreival : O(n)
    - Resizing (appending, prepending) - CONSTANT O(1)

    Single
    Double: Inserting, deleting O(1) ONLY if you have a pointer to the node you want to delete or insert infront ofor behind of

    Uses less memory? How is this??
